## Overwiew

Our project goal is to create a robotic checkers board, that a human player can play checkers against.
Since building a custom robot arm is really difficult, decided we to build a different kind of solution.
We will try to build a special checkers board that has a moving electromagnet under the board itself, that can move the checkers pieces by activating the electromagnet under them and dragging the pieces around the table. The pieces themselves will have small amount of metal in them. The movement of the electromagnet is a little bit more complicated.
We would like to build a 2 axis linear actuation system under the board, using two stepper motors. The system will be something akin to to 3d printers or cnc machines.
The movement logic will be controlled by a computer that will read the board and position of the pieces from an overhead webcam. It is going to be able to recognise opponent movement and using that information calculate and execute its next move.
